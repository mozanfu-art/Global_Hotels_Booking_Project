# Global_Hotels_Booking_Project
This is a repository for IT8-semester project Global Hotels Booking App created by Group-B members and supervised by Ust. Anas Mohamed.
A Breif about our project:
Hotels Booking is a web application that helps travelers contact multiple hotels in designated cities and choose easily between them; 
allowing you to minimize searching time by offering a bundle of hotels in the same city with ease of use.
Our website allows you to search for properties nearby and worldwide, fill in a few details, and secure your reservation. 
The website provides a user-friendly platform for booking accommodations worldwide, connect travelers with hotels, and offer competitive pricing.
We aim to help ease the struggles of finding a good hotel and facilitate a smooth operation for both the hotels and the guests, 
with a goal to soon have hotels on our page from every city worldwide
